## Have troubles setting up the project or working on the code??

Frequent and Potential issues:

1. Unable to run the backend using Flask

Solution:
Install using the requirements.txt file and check the python version on the machine used.

2. Linter showing errors in the frontend

Solution:
Because typescript is being used, please check if your types are declared as they ought to and you are not violating them during assignments.

3. Backend endpoints are working on POSTMAN but throwing CORS error in the browser

Solution:
Check if you have added the CORS decorator to the endpoint
